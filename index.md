## About Me

Hi! My name is Matthew Lee. I am currently working as a high school science teacher in Houston, Texas. I began coding in the summer of 2020, and have developed a wide range of skills; through the help/guidance of DigitalCrafts. Currently, I am unsure as to what I would like to do, once I graduate from this course. Whether I go into a new field (job), or stay at my current one, I hope to utilize my new coding skills to help solve various problems that I wouldn't have been able to before. Ever since the arrival of COVID-19, learning processes have evolved, but teaching methods have not. An example of one problem at my current job, would be figuring out ways to make labs for my virtual students. There are multiple online resources/labs for students to takle, but a majority of them are... bland. I hope to, one day in the near future, create some chemistry/physics labs that: educates, is engaging, and most importantly - fun!
